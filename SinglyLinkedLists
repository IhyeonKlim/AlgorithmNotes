Objectives.

define what a singly linked list is.

compare and contrast linked lists with arrays.

implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on singly lined lists.


what is a linked list?

array. index.

no index.

each elements are nod.

head. begin
tail. end

**singly linked lists.
               total length = 4
   head                            tail 
    4    ->    6   ->    8   ->    2  -> 
        next      next      next      null

단일방향으로 연결되어있다.

array ='엘리베이터 있는 고층건물' = 바로 간다.
linked list = "엘베 없음." = 하나하나 걸어올라가야한다.

lists
    do not have indexes.
    connected via nodes with a next pointer
    random access is not allowed
    it have to has 'head'
    -> best of insertion and deletion
    
arrays
    indexed in order
    insertion and deletion can be expensive
    can quickly be accessed at a specific index.

cf. visualgo.
